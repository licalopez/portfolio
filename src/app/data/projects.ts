		description: `LN Associates Inc is a Canadian tax filing corporation that specializes in tax preparation and audit assistance. The goal for this website was to create a clean and minimal layout that reflected the company’s professionalism while maintaining visual simplicity that wouldn’t overwhelm the user. The general page styling was done with CSS and Sass incorporating a fully responsive layout, scripts were coded using Vanilla JavaScript, and all header images were photographed by myself and compressed to accommodate various viewport sizes.`,

		description: `A fun side project, "Emma" is inspired by the Jane Austen novel of the same name. The concept was to take the events of the novel and narrate them in the form of first-person online blog posts, readable in both light mode and dark mode versions. With this project, I combined two of my passions — web development and literature — to create a blog with functioning CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations. It's a fullstack project with a structured frontend layout and an equally structured backend configuration. The blog owner has the ability to create, update and delete blog posts directly from the site itself with the aid of a RESTful API linked to a MongoDB database. Each blog post is viewable to all, but submitting and deleting comments are reserved for authenticated users.`,

The entire application is constructed using Next.js to render the frontend, fetch the required data, and handle payments through the backend. Working with relational data like brands, camera products, product images, and featured deals for specific products — as well as relying on features like Search fields and filter systems —, it was important to set up a structured schema and manage the data in an organized manner, which was conducted with Sanity.io. Payments are made through a custom backend API and processed by the payment platform, Stripe. The application's layout is completely responsive and accessibility-friendly, ensuring total ease of use for all consumers.`,
